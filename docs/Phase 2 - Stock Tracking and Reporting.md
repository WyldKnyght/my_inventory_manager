For Phase 2, the focus is on enhancing the system with stock tracking and reporting capabilities. Here's a checklist of tasks to guide you through this phase:

### Phase 2 Checklist: Stock Tracking and Reporting

#### 1. **Database Enhancements**
- [ ] Review and update the `Items` table to ensure it includes a `quantity` field for stock tracking.
- [ ] Add any additional fields needed for reporting, such as `last_updated` or `reorder_level`.

#### 2. **Backend Logic**
- [ ] Implement logic to update stock levels when items are added or removed.
- [ ] Develop functions to generate basic inventory reports, such as:
  - [ ] Current stock levels for each item.
  - [ ] Low stock alerts based on `reorder_level`.
- [ ] Create methods to periodically update or refresh stock data.

#### 3. **User Interface Enhancements**
- [ ] Update the Tkinter UI to include stock level indicators for each item.
- [ ] Add a section or tab for viewing inventory reports.
- [ ] Implement UI elements for setting and displaying `reorder_level` for items.

#### 4. **Reporting Features**
- [ ] Design and implement a basic reporting interface to display:
  - [ ] List of items with current stock levels.
  - [ ] Items that are low in stock or need reordering.
- [ ] Allow users to export reports to a file format (e.g., CSV) for external use.

#### 5. **Testing**
- [ ] Test stock tracking functionality to ensure accurate updates when items are added or removed.
- [ ] Verify that reports accurately reflect the current state of inventory.
- [ ] Test the UI to ensure that stock levels and alerts are displayed correctly.

#### 6. **Documentation**
- [ ] Update user documentation to include instructions on using stock tracking and reporting features.
- [ ] Document any changes to the database schema or backend logic.

#### 7. **Review and Feedback**
- [ ] Review the completed phase for any improvements or optimizations.
- [ ] Gather feedback from users on the new stock tracking and reporting features.

By completing these tasks, you will enhance your inventory management system with essential stock tracking and reporting capabilities, providing valuable insights into inventory levels and helping manage stock efficiently. If you need further guidance on any specific tasks, feel free to ask!
