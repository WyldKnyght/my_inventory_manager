For a small side business focused on managing trading cards and collectibles, you can create a simple yet effective inventory management system using no-cost tools and technologies. Here's a recommended technology stack that aligns with your requirements:

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend

- **Technology**: Tkinter
  - **Reason**: Tkinter is a built-in Python library for creating simple graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It is suitable for desktop applications and does not require additional installations beyond Python itself.
  - **Features**: Provides basic widgets like buttons, labels, and entry fields, which are sufficient for a straightforward inventory management system.

#### Backend

- **Language**: Python
  - **Reason**: Python is versatile, easy to learn, and well-suited for both backend processing and GUI development with Tkinter.
  - **Framework**: Since this is a desktop application, you don't need a web framework like Flask or Django. You can handle backend logic directly in Python scripts.

#### Database

- **Database**: SQLite
  - **Reason**: SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that is ideal for small applications. It is included with Python, so there are no additional setup costs or complexity.
  - **Features**: Supports SQL queries, making it easy to manage and query your inventory data.

### Additional Tools

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
  - **Reason**: VS Code is a free, powerful, and extensible IDE that supports Python development with features like debugging, linting, and version control integration.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install Python from the official website if not already installed.
   - Set up VS Code with the Python extension for enhanced development features.

2. **Design the User Interface**:
   - Use Tkinter to create a simple GUI with forms for adding, editing, and deleting items.
   - Include fields for item name, series, edition, condition, rarity, and market value.

3. **Implement Backend Logic**:
   - Write Python scripts to handle data processing, including adding items to the database, updating records, and generating reports.

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Use SQLite to create a database file (e.g., `inventory.db`) and define tables for storing inventory data.
   - Write SQL queries to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

5. **Test the Application**:
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Make adjustments based on any issues or user feedback.

6. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Since this is a desktop application, deployment involves packaging the application for easy distribution. You can use tools like PyInstaller to create an executable file.

### Conclusion

This technology stack and approach will allow you to build a cost-effective inventory management system tailored to your small business needs. By leveraging Python and its built-in libraries, you can minimize overhead while creating a functional and user-friendly application.
