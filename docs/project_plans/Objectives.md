### Project Plan
A phased approach to developing an inventory management system that will be incrementally built and testing the system, ensuring that each phase delivers a functional component. This approach is aligned with agile development practices, which focus on delivering value early and often. 

### Phase 1: Core Inventory Management

**Objective**: Establish the basic functionality for managing items and categories.

- **Features**:
  - Implement database tables to store basic information.
  - Enable basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for database tables.
  - Develop a simple user interface for adding, editing, and deleting items and categories.
  - 
- **Outcome**: A basic inventory system that allows you to manage items and categories, providing a foundation for further development.

### Phase 2: Stock Tracking and Reporting

**Objective**: Enhance the system with stock tracking and reporting capabilities.

- **Features**:
  - Add stock quantity tracking to the `Items` table.
  - Implement basic reporting features to display current inventory levels and low stock alerts.
  - Develop a user interface to view and manage stock levels.

- **Outcome**: A system that not only manages items and categories but also tracks stock levels and provides basic reporting.

### Phase 3: Merchandise Processing

**Objective**: Introduce functionality for handling purchases and sales.

- **Features**:
  - Implement the `Purchases` and `Sales` tables to record transactions.
  - Develop interfaces for recording purchase and sale transactions.
  - Update stock levels automatically based on purchases and sales.

- **Outcome**: A system capable of processing merchandise transactions, updating inventory levels accordingly.

### Phase 4: Collectibles and Trading Cards

**Objective**: Add specialized features for managing collectibles and trading cards.

- **Features**:
  - Implement the `Collectibles` and `TradingCards` tables to store specific attributes.
  - Develop interfaces for managing collectibles and trading card details, such as series, edition, and condition.
  - Integrate basic rarity and condition grading features.

- **Outcome**: A system that supports the unique needs of managing trading cards and collectibles.

### Phase 5: Market Value Integration and Advanced Features

**Objective**: Integrate real-time market data and add advanced features.

- **Features**:
  - Integrate with external APIs to update market values for trading cards and collectibles.
  - Implement advanced search and filter capabilities.
  - Add customizable dashboards for viewing key metrics and insights.

- **Outcome**: A comprehensive inventory management system with advanced features and real-time market integration.
