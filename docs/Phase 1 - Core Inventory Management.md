For Phase 1, where the goal is to establish basic inventory management functionality, here's a checklist of tasks to guide you through the development process:

### Phase 1 Checklist: Core Inventory Management

#### 1. **Database Setup**
- [X] Design the database schema.
- [X] Create the SQLite database file.
- [X] Implement the tables with fields, as per the Database Schema.

#### 2. **Backend Logic**
- [X] Write Python scripts to connect to the SQLite database.
- [X] Implement CRUD operations for tables:

#### 3. **User Interface Design**
- [X] Use PyQT to create the main application window.
- [ ] Design a form for adding and editing items, including fields for name, description, quantity, and category.
- [ ] Design a form for adding and editing categories.
- [ ] Create a list or table view to display existing items and categories.

#### 4. **Integration**
- [ ] Connect the  UI with backend logic to perform CRUD operations.
- [ ] Ensure that changes in the UI are reflected in the database and vice versa.

#### 5. **Testing**
- [ ] Test the application to ensure that all CRUD operations work as expected.
- [ ] Verify that the UI updates correctly when items or categories are added, edited, or deleted.
- [ ] Check for any errors or exceptions and handle them gracefully.

#### 6. **Documentation**
- [ ] Document the database schema and application architecture.
- [ ] Write user documentation to guide users on how to use the application.

#### 7. **Review and Feedback**
- [ ] Review the completed phase for any improvements or optimizations.
- [ ] Gather feedback from potential users or stakeholders.

By completing these tasks, you will have a functional core inventory management system that allows you to manage items and categories effectively. This foundation will set the stage for subsequent phases where you can build on this functionality. If you need any specific guidance or examples for any of these tasks, feel free to ask!
